## 🎯 What I'm Working On

- 🛒 **Multi-Tenant E-commerce System** – Architecting a scalable, multi-tenant system where merchants can manage products, locations, and customers independently. I'm integrating a **voucher system** that rewards customers with discounts and special offers based on their membership points.

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control** – Building a customizable dashboard for SaaS businesses with granular permission control. The system allows admins to assign roles and manage user permissions seamlessly, all powered by **AdonisJS**.

- 💳 **Subscription-Based Services** – Developing a recurring payment system using **AdonisJS**. It handles silent billing, notifications for failed transactions, and offers users various subscription plans to choose from.
